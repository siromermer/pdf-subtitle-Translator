for me when i read pdf in computer most painful  part is change the tab and search for the word that i dont know the meaning , by the way it very time consuming . 
and one other painful thing is watching movies with english subtitle , it is hard to understant in some points with this program just clicking one button solves my problem

With this litte project by pressing four different button you can get 4 different voice output :
1) Translated word (language that you want to hear)
2) pronunciation of word 
3) synonym  of word 
4) 	antonym  of word

!!!
How it work and how should YOU use it ? 
!!!
you need to center your mouse the word that you want and after that you need to put buttons it is quite easy and you can change buttons whatever button you want

SS COORDÄ°NATES , USER NEEDS TO ADJUST THEM (for example i like reading pdf's with whole page , but user may want to see only paragraph or sentence )
in this case user has to increase or decrease constants max(0, x - 120) 120 in this case    
in my opinion best way to do it by trial and error , after 3 or 4 shot  you are gonna get results
    
    # you need to adjust these constant values 
    left = max(0, x - 120)  
    top = max(0, y - 23)    
    right = min(width, x + 120)    
    bottom = min(height, y + 23) 

when i read i zoom the paragraphs(too much) and i read like that

below , example ss when user press one of the 4 button
